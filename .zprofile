# When using MacVim (or GVim) as $VISUAL or $EDITOR, you should be 
# aware that by default MacVim will fork a new process from the parent, resulting in the 
# MacVim return value not reaching the parent process. This may confuse other applications, 
# but Git seems to check the status of a temporary commit message file, which bypasses 
# this limitation. In general, it is a good practice to export VISUAL='mvim -f' to ensure 
# MacVim will not fork a new process when called, which should give you what you want 
# when using it with your shell environment.
